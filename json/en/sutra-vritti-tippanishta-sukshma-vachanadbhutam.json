        "Elaborately explaining the aphorisms taught in Sanskrit grammar and the science of logic, Śrī Gaurasundar would draw out their apparent and subtle meanings. The Lord’s beautiful style of deriving the inner significance of the sūtras completely amazed all the learned circles. The Lord demonstrated that the seven thousand verbal root sounds contained in Sanskrit grammar reach the zenith of their expression when realized as potencies existing within the Krishna conception of reality. As the learned scholars sat in utter amazement, their powerful intellects were paralyzed by Lord Gaurāṅga’s intriguing explanation. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gaurāṅga Sundar, the divine form of Krishna-*prema*."

        "Śrī Gaurasundar proved that the Supreme Lord’s sweet will and well-wishing glance is the background cause governing each sound’s concomitant meaning. The Lord’s sanction is the fundamental element deciding the orderly arrangement and harmony shared between sound and its meaning, and not the mundane endeavors of the prominent grammarians headed by the sages like Pāṇini, who try to affix sounds with word meanings. This is because the purpose of everything animate or inanimate in existence is ultimately to please the Supreme Lord by enhancing His charming Pastimes. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gaurāṅga Sundar, the divine form of Krishna-*prema*."

        "The Lord began to teach Sanskrit to His students again after returning from Gayā. However, when emotions arising from pure love overwhelmed the Lord, He was unable to continue teaching them. Nimāi’s personal students, bereft of the opportunity to learn from the Lord, condemned themselves as unfortunate. Lamenting, they humbly praised the unparalleled genius of the Lord’s teachings. Although the Lord experienced grief due to sympathetic feelings towards His students, He acted as their ever well-wisher when He inaugurated the happy glorification of Lord Krishna by chanting “haraye namaḥ kṛṣṇa” as they clapped in unison. In the wake of the congregational chanting, the moving and nonmoving living entities in all ten directions were immersed in the surging waves of that grand ocean of sweet devotional mellows. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gaurāṅga Sundar, the divine form of Krishna-*prema*."

The Lord would continuously chant and distribute Lord Krishna’s Holy Names, dancing in the most joyful manner in the association of thousands of devotees. In this way He delivered the greatest of demons such as Jagāi and Madhāi, and other demoniac groups who destroy religious principles and the rules governing the social and spiritual orders of society.

        "Once, a great Mohammedan city magistrate named Chāṅd Kāzī obstructed the devotees from performing congregational chanting of the Lord’s Holy Names. In retaliation, Lord Chaitanyadeva dispelled the devotees’ fear by leading a nocturnal chanting procession ornamented with thousands of burning torches and lamps. Millions of persons simultaneously joined in the ecstatic wave created by Lord Gaurasundar’s dancing to the sweet melody of the mṛdaṅga drums and cymbals, as musical instruments resounded in every direction. When the powerful Mohammedan witnessed this, his false sense of covetousness was cleansed, and the Lord embraced him as His very own.

        "Arriving in the sacred place of pilgrimage, Śrī Nīlāchala, the valiant king of the renounced order, Śrī Chaitanyadeva, saved the most powerful scholar recognized throughout the length and breadth of India. Śrī Vāsudeva Sārvabhauma, the most dynamic intellectual of all time in the vast Vedantic doctrine and school of logistics, was rescued by the Lord from the impersonal well of Śaṅkarāchārya’s theory. Later, the Lord travelled to southern India, where He encountered the followers of various philisophical doctrines. Wherever He travelled, the aspirations of the devotees met their highest fulfillment, as the Lord was like a desire tree. On the banks of the Godāvarī River, the Lord met that deep raincloud of pure dedication Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya, and instructed him to shower upon others the sweet raindrops of rasa which exist in the land of spontaneous devotion, Vraja. Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya also answered the questions the merciful Lord posed with the essence of all instruction.
