        "Lord Gaurasundar revealed His disciplic line by inspiring Śrīla Sanātan Goswāmī, his younger brother Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī, and Śrīla Jīva Goswāmī. The Lord requested them to excavate the lost places of pilgrimage and compose pure devotional literature which describes the application of spiritual practices and spontaneous devotion. Lord Gaurāṅga also lovingly revealed His worshipable personality to the servitors of Śrī Jagannāth Deva at Nīlāchala (Śrī Purī-dhām). I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gaurāṅga Sundar, the divine form of Krishna-*prema*."

        "Lord Gaurasundar strongly condemned those who externally accepted the dress of a renunciate yet, like monkeys, actually harbored desires for sense pleasures. On the other hand, He honoured that great devotee Rāmānanda Rāya’s devotional efforts to intimately teach some young girls a form of dance drama for the pleasure of Lord Jagannāth. Considering Rāmānanda’s service to be on the platform of spontaneous devotion, the Lord proclaimed that such a level of service was a great fortune attainable only after millions of births. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gaurāṅga Sundar, the divine form of Krishna-*prema*."

        "The famous spiritual preceptor of the Viṣṇuswāmī disciplic succession *śuddhādvaita*, Śrī Vallabha Bhaṭṭa, lived in the village of Āḍhāila in sacred Prayāga, and personally served Lord Gaurāṅgadev with resolute devotion in his residence. Later in Jagannāth Purī, Lord Gaurāṅga allowed Vallabha Bhaṭṭa to enter into and relish the sweet taste experienced in parental attachment to baby Krishna. The Lord also arranged for him to learn the appropriate mantras for his worship from Śrī Gadādhara Paṇḍīt.

        "Diving deep into the reality of His own beauty and sweetness, Lord Govinda stole the mood of Rādhārāṇī and, garbing Himself in Her brilliant lustre, appeared as Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. For the last twelve years of His manifest Pastimes He was deeply absorbed in union and separation, and He shared His heart’s inner feelings with His most confidential devotees such as Swarūp Dāmodar and Rāmānanda Rāya: *bāhire viṣajvālā hoy, antare ānandamoy*.",
        "“The wonderful characteristic of divine love of Krishna is that although externally it works like fiery lava, internally it is like sweet nectar that fills the heart with the greatest joy.” Volcanic eruptions of ecstasy flowed from the heart of Śrī Gaurāṅga in the agony of separation from Krishna. This Golden Lord, who appeared like an intoxicated elephant, is none other than Lord Govinda. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gaurāṅga Sundar, the divine form of Krishna-*prema*."

The Lord would continuously taste the mood of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, who was experiencing untold agony from the burning fire of Her tragic separation from Lord Krishna. With a heavy heart, the Lord would describe what He was directly realising in divine trance. Those realisations are just like dreams to ordinary men.

Sometimes He appeared like a tortoise who had withdrawn his limbs into his shell, and at other times His body appeared elongated due to His joints becoming dislocated. Sometimes Lord Gaurasundar’s figure was as tender and aromatic as a lotus flower. At other times the Lord’s body would appear red, yellow, or brilliant with the white hue of the jasmine flower.

In deep separation He manifested the form of the tortoise incarnation Kūrmadeva, and an extraordinarily sweet fragrance began to emanate from the Lord’s unconscious figure. This attracted the *telāṅgī* cows who resided at Lord Jagannāth’s Temple, and they surrounded the Lord.

Suddenly the Lord saw the reflection of the moon dancing upon the rolling waves. Unexpectedly, the Lord became overwhelmed by recollections of Lord Krishna’s Pastimes in the Yamunā River and fell unconscious. Next, Lord Gaurāṅga’s body, unseen by the devotees, became as light as a piece of dried wood and was gracefully carried away by the wind-god while lying upon the crest of the ocean’s rolling waves in a divine trance. Realizing Lord Krishna’s water-sport Pastimes in the Kālindī River with His dearmost cowherd-maiden friends, the Lord dove deep into an ocean of divine ecstasy. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gaurāṅga Sundar, the divine form of Krishna-*prema*."
