        "Śrīla Krishnadās Kavirāj prays, “First I offer my respects unto the lotus feet of my initiating spiritual masters and the recruiting spiritual masters and advanced Vaiṣṇavas. Next I offer my obeisances to my śāstra gurus, Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī, his elder brother, Śrīla Sanātan Goswāmī, Śrīla Raghunāth Dās Goswāmī, and Śrīla Jīva Goswāmī. On a higher platform I offer my respects unto Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, who came with His paraphernalia and associates, along with those great personalities Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu and Śrī Advaita Āchārya. And in the highest stage, I offer my obeisances unto the lotus feet of Śrī Śrī Rādhā and Govinda, and all of the gopīs, headed by Lalitā devī and Viśākhā devī.”"
