In the company of his brothers, he was resplendent in (the province of) Gauḍa, causing the fervent twin bumblebees in the form of the lotus eyes of Śrī Chaitanyadev to drink nectar, as the Lord’s lotus feet moved on the pretext of visiting Vṛndāvan. When will that Śrīmad Rūpa Prabhu grace me with the dust of his holy feet?"

        "At Śrī Rāmakeli Dhām, the king of bees—the heart of Śrī Rūpa—became intoxicated drinking the honey-wine of the lotus feet of Śrī Gaurachandra, and sacrificed its life (in Hari-kīrtan) for the benefit of all the people of the world, summarily abandoning a life of kingly opulence. After informing his elder brother Śrī Sanātan, Śrī Rūpa and his younger brother Śrī Vallabha followed the footsteps of Śrī Chaitanyadev, whose heart was absorbed in going (from Nīlāchala) to Śrī Vṛndāvan.

Intoxicated with divine love, dancing, He melted the hearts of hundreds of faithful souls with His astonishing transcendental ecstasies. Śrī Rūpa, as though regaining his most precious treasure, thus found Śrī Chaitanyadev in the direct presence of the Deity Śrī Bindu Mādhava.
