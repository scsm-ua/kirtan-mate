        "The chief of the Demigods, whose body is decorated by snakes, whose body shines like the moon, who has five heads, who carries his weapon known as Paśupat, who gives boons, who is of satisfied nature, who holds the Gaṅgā on his head, who maintains those who give obeisance to him, who is easily pleased — I offer my obeisances to Sadā-śiva who is dear to Hari, and whose crown is the moon."
