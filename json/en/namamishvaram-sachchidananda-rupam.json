        "[Seeing the whipping stick in His mother’s hand,] He is crying and rubbing His eyes again and again with His two lotus hands. His eyes are filled with fear, and the necklace of pearls around His neck, which is marked with three lines like a conchshell, is shaking because of His quick breathing due to crying. To this Supreme Lord, Śrī Dāmodar, whose belly is bound not with ropes but with His mother’s pure love, I offer my humble obeisances."

With great love I again offer my obeisances to Lord Dāmodar hundreds and hundreds of times."
