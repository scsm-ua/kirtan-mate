His transcendental form bent in three places, playing wonderfully on His flute, He is the reservoir of all relishable mellows and is the abode of all virtuous qualities."

        "By such a beautiful form He is maddening the entire universe. His complexion is like that of a fresh new rain cloud, His head is decorated with a big peacock feather, and the sandalwood tilak on His forehead is most becoming. Wearing brilliant yellow-coloured garments, He stands with His face decorated by a wide, sweet smile."

Seeing this, my mind has become so restless that my feet will move no longer, and I’ve completely forgotten about my family and home life in this world."
