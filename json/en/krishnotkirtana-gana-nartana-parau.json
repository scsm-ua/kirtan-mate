        "I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Six Goswāmīs, namely Śrī Rūpa Goswāmī, Śrī Sanātan Goswāmī, Śrī Raghunāth Bhaṭṭa Goswāmī, Śrī Raghunāth Dās Goswāmī, Śrī Jīva Goswāmī, and Śrī Gopāl Bhaṭṭa Goswāmī, who are always engaged in chanting the Holy Name of Krishna and dancing. They are just like the ocean of love of God, and they are popular both with the gentle and with the ruffians, because they are not envious of anyone. Whatever they do, they are all-pleasing to everyone, and they are fully blessed by Lord Chaitanya. Thus they are engaged in missionary activities meant to deliver all the conditioned souls in the material universe."

Thus they are honoured all over the three worlds, and they are worth taking shelter of because they are absorbed in the mood of the gopīs and are engaged in the transcendental loving service of Rādhā and Krishna."

They can purify all conditioned souls from the reactions of their sinful activities by pouring upon them transcendental songs about Govinda. As such, they are very expert in increasing the limits of the ocean of transcendental bliss, and they are the saviours of the living entities from the devouring mouth of liberation."

In order to deliver the poor conditioned souls, they accepted loincloths, treating themselves as mendicants, but they are always merged in the ecstatic ocean of the gopīs’ love for Krishna and bathe always and repeatedly in the waves of that ocean."

The Goswāmīs are perfectly competent to bestow upon the living entities the greatest boon of the goal of life."

In this way they utilised their valuable lives, and in executing these devotional activities they conquered over eating and sleeping and were always meek and humble, enchanted by remembering the transcendental qualities of the Lord."

There they appeared just like madmen in the full ecstasy of love for Krishna, exhibiting different transcendental symptoms in their bodies, and they were merged in the ecstasy of Krishna consciousness."

Where are you?” These were their moods in executing Krishna consciousness."
