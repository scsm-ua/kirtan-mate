Ananta Śeṣa constantly holds the weight of the Earth planet upon His innumerable hoods as if it were an insignificant particle of dust. Ananta Śeṣa serves the Lord in several ways, manifesting  Himself as the Lord’s personal umbrella, resting place, and clothing.

Lord Nityānanda’s presence is further extended in His expansion as Kāraṇodaśāyī Viṣṇu, the supplying principle encompassing unlimited universes.

That all-attractive personality, Śrī Saṅkarṣaṇa., performs His wonderful Pastimes in the spiritual realm in the regions known as Mathurā and Dvārakā. The trascendental city of Dvārakā is situated just below the city of Mathurā. It is in these spiritual places that Lord Saṅkarṣaṇa and His associates Anirudhha and Pradyumna exhibit Their particular Pastimes scripturally known as prabhāva-vilāsaḥ. Nityānanda Prabhu in the form of Lord Balarāma is the ultimate source of all incarnations, and sportively plays in the charming village of Vrajapura with His younger brother Lord Krishna.
