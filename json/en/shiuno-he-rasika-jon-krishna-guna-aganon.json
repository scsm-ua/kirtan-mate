Krishna is the spiritual master of the entire universe, He is like a wish-fulfilling desire-tree, and He is the helmsman of the boat on the ocean of material existence."

Giving the honey of His lotus feet, and thus relieving the darkness of such worldliness, He makes one an attendant of His own feet."

Becoming influenced by such spontaneity, remaining under the shelter of the mellows of unwedded love (<i class=\"SongVerse__term\">pārakīya-bhāva</i>), the soul finally attains all the symptoms of ecstatic love for Krishna."
