        "O my mind, how foolish you are. Just worship the lotus feet of Rādhā and Krishna in the forest of Vraja. Without such worship there is no means of spiritual advancement. Give up all speculative knowledge and materialistic activities and just worship Rādhā and Krishna in the forests of Vraja."

Knowing Lord Gaura and Lord Krishna to be the same, and knowing the Spiritual Master to be very dear to Krishna, you should remember the dear associates of Lord Chaitanya, such as Śrīvās Ṭhākur, Haridās Ṭhākur, Murāri Gupta, and Mukunda Datta. In deep love for Lord Gaura, you should remember the two great personalities Śrīvās Ṭhākur and Haridās Ṭhākur."
