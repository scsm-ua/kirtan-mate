Śrī Chaitanyadeva is compared to that grand milk ocean which, after being churned, produced nectar.

Sārvabhauma used the most deceitful means in the art of word jugglery. He tried to pervert the sense of words, he idly heckled the arguments or assertions of the Lord without attempting to prove the opposite side, and he tried to find the weak points in the Lord’s arguments. However, Śrī Chaitanya, whose charming figure was cloaked in the fresh garments of a radiant renunciate, presented consistent arguments in conjunction with the Vedic literatures, and easily checked and destroyed the scholar’s atheistic interpretations. The Lord loudly proclaimed that the doctrine of Śaṅkarāchārya is practiced by followers in the ascending method of understanding who are interested in their external selfadoration. Such worship is the product of a demoniac intellect and backed by atheistic perseverance. All importance given to the nonmanifest aspect of material nature was refuted when Lord Gaurasundar established that spiritual variegatedness in the Supreme Lord’s personality is the highest reality taught in the Vedic literature.",
