        "In regard to Lord Chaitanya’s Pastimes, Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī has mentioned the following verse in his Śrī Chaitanyāṣṭakam:",

        "“The gods, headed by Lord Shiva and Lord Brahmā, accepted the garb of ordinary men in the Pastimes of Śrī Chaitanyadeva in order to eternally worship Him with heartfelt affection.” Śrī Chaitanyadeva is the embodiment of that vast nectarean ocean found in Lord Krishna’s Holy Name, which is none other than Śrī Gaurāṅga’s own pure Name. Śrī Chaitanyadeva is compared to that grand milk ocean which, after being churned, produced nectar. The nectar Mahāprabhu distributes is Lord Krishna’s Holy Names, which extinguish all the miseries of material existence, such as anxieties arising from sinful activities performed in direct opposition to the Lord, and the three-fold sufferings which fuel the grand forest fire that scorches those in search of sense gratification, salvation, and mystic yoga perfections. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gaurāṅga Sundar, the divine form of Krishna-*prema*."

        "The charming aura of Śrī Gaurasundar’s divine figure resembles the reflection of millions of radiant golden mirrors. Furthermore, the personified sweet fragrance of the earthly and heavenly lotus flowers humbly offer their prayers before the aromatic scent which permeates the air from the beautiful form of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. Millions and millions of Cupids fall unconscious before the feet of Śrī Chaitanyadeva’s elegant figure. They are severely shocked because their sense of universal fame arising from their beautiful splendor is checked. While performing His joyful Pastimes of dancing, the divine form of Śrī Gaurāṅgadev playfully sways to and fro. The flowing pulsations of the Lord’s limbs move in rhythm with the various charming moods of devotional sentiments, bhāva, overwhelming His graceful figure. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gaurāṅga Sundar, the divine form of Krishna-*prema*."

        "By manifesting His five-fold aspect of divinity, Pañcha-tattva, Śrī Gaurāṅgadev was able to widely distribute the sweet Names of Lord Krishna, which is the means to the ultimate attainment in human life: unalloyed love for the Absolute Truth, Śrī Krishna, the fifth end. (The ‘fifth end’ refers to that which is beyond the attainment of religiosity, economic development, sense gratification, and liberation.) The Lord personally incarnated on the Earth planet with His expansions such as Nityānanda Prabhu and Advaita Āchārya, His intimate associates such as Gadādhara Paṇḍit, and His other general associates such as Śrīvāsa Ṭhākur. When the Lord appears, He comes armed with the weapon of the Holy Name of Krishna. While dancing in the deepest ecstasies of pure love, Lord Gaurāṅgadev, although none other than Śyāmasundar, chanted His own Names just like an ordinary citizen in the Nadīyā district. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gaurāṅga Sundar, the divine form of Krishna-*prema*."

The Lord incarnated because He was unable to tolerate the griefstricken condition of Śrī Advaita Āchārya, the master of that charming village of Śāntipura. Śrī Advaita Āchārya was lamenting about this era being overtaken by the ugly influence of irreligious practices. Thus, in order to arrest the immoral activities in *Kali-yuga*, the Lord profusely distributed the sweet nectar of Lord Krishna’s Holy Names. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gaurāṅga Sundar, the divine form of Krishna-*prema*."

Revealing His household Pastimes in the holy abode of Nabadwīp, Śrī Gaura benedicted the beautiful courtyard surrounding Śrīnivās Paṇḍit’s residence, and pleased His dearmost associates when He manifested His nocturnal Pastimes of congregational chanting in the deepest mellows of pure dedication. The controlling life-force of Lakṣmī Priyā Devī and Viṣṇu Priyā Devī was Śrī Gaurasundar, whose intelligence was couched in  deep parental adoration for His mother and father, Śachī Devī and Jagannāth Miśra. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gaurāṅga Sundar, the divine form of Krishna-*prema*."

Nimāi’s Pastimes, although naughty, were not only pleasing to Him, but also gladdened the hearts of His devotees.",
        "During His adolescent years, the Lord acquired unrivaled mastery over the conclusions of the ancient Scriptures. With unexcelled logic at His command, Lord Viśvambhara artfully established the auspicious doctrine of śuddha-bhakti, unalloyed dedication unto the Sweet Absolute Truth, Lord Krishna, thereby defeating the doctrine of dry logic studied at that period by the proud, expert logicians who were all nearly atheistic scholars. Later, in the course of His adolescent Pastimes, the Lord vanquished the pride of the most famous Sanskrit scholar of all time, the Digvijayī Paṇḍit, in the company of His grammar students, on the banks of the Ganges River. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gaurāṅga Sundar, the divine form of Krishna-*prema*."

        "Once, Nimāi was stolen away by two thieves who were intent on robbing the ornaments decorating His charming figure. Placing Nimāi on their shoulders, they enticed the small boy to come with them and then quickly fled away with Him. However, due to the Lord’s Yogamāyā potency, they suddenly found they had arrived at Nimāi’s house.",
        "Later, a well-known mendicant *brāhmaṇ* visited the residence of Jagannāth Miśra. When the *brāhmaṇ* began to offer some preparations he had cooked to Lord Gopāl, Nimāi spoiled the offering by eating the foodstuffs while the mendicant was offering them in meditation. After having done this to the *brāhmaṇ* three times, the Lord revealed His eight-armed form to him.",
        "Whenever the child Nimāi angrily cried, He could only be pacified by the chanting of Lord Krishna’s Holy Names. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gaurāṅga Sundar, the divine form of Krishna-*prema*."

At the Lord’s request, he spontaneously composed and recited many wonderful prayers in glorification of the sacred Ganges. Śrī Gaurāṅgadev then amazed the scholar when He recollected and pointed out several rhetorical errors in his compositions. Keśava Kāśmīrī skillfully presented many logical arguments in his own favour, but was ultimately defeated. Finally, when Keśava Kāśmīrī’s incompetence was exposed and his intelligence was totally perplexed, Lord Gaurāṅga compassionately respected him in a manner befitting a great scholar by preventing His students who were present from laughing at the paṇḍit. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gaurāṅga Sundar, the divine form of Krishna-*prema*."
