        "In the sacred waters of the Yamunā in Vṛndāvan, Śrī Rādhā-Govinda, along with Their dearmost cowherd-maiden friends, perform various charming water-sport Pastimes. These divine Pastimes are sometimes revealed, sometimes hidden, sometimes in opposition to each other, and sometimes harmonious. In this way the Lord’s Pastimes are couched in different gestures which bring about different types of divine hankering. The melodious tune of this confidential spiritual treasure which astounds the entire universe was distributed by Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gaurāṅga Sundar, the divine form of Krishna-*prema*."

        "Upon glancing at the Chāṭaka hill, intolerable feelings of separation overwhelmed the Lord, and different Pastimes in the mood of profound adoration were incited, whereby the Lord began to rub His beautiful face on the ground. When Śrī Gaurāṅga would remember the water-sport Pastimes of Lord Krishna, He would jump into the ocean and exhibit the divine symptoms of one intoxicated by pure love. By performing these Pastimes, the Lord would inundate the devotees’ hearts with waves from the grand ocean of love of Krishna. Those desperate waves carried both transcendental anxiety and joy up onto the shore of the devotees’ hearts. Such inconceivable auspiciousness was bestowed only upon the Lord’s most surrendered associates. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gaurāṅga Sundar, the divine form of Krishna-*prema*."

        "Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu is not only beyond the mundane experiences of sight and sound, but He also arrests all intellectual endeavors to know Him. Being situated in pure love of Godhead, He remains a mystery and astonishes even those living entities who are fixed in self-realization. The revealed Vedas of Lord Brahmā and the Tantric literatures of Lord Shiva are simply searching after Śrī Gaurasundar, reality the beautiful. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gaurāṅga Sundar, the divine form of Krishna-*prema*."

The Lord alone was the embodiment of the greatest wealth for all sincere and gentle souls, both the rich and the poor, the aristocratic and the lowborn. Therefore, Lord Chaitanya is respected and honoured by men and women alike as the saviour of all, in both the mundane and spiritual worlds.

When the Absolute Truth Śrī Gaurāṅgadev incarnated in the beautiful courtyard of Śachī Devī, the residents of Māyāpur were bathing in the sacred Ganges, congregationally chanting the Holy Names of Hari, and making offerings of various types of jewels to the Lord. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gaurāṅga Sundar, the divine form of Krishna-*prema*."

        "This is the all-conquering conclusion: the highest conception of the Ultimate Reality must also be the highest form of *ānanda*, ecstasy. Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu is Krishna, ecstasy Himself, tasting His own sweetness and dancing in ecstatic joy. His own Holy Name is the cause of His ecstasy, expressed as dancing, and the Holy Name is the effect of His ecstasy, expressed as chanting. The cause is the effect. The dynamo is creating ecstatic energy which makes Him dance, and His chanting distributes that ecstasy to others. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gaurāṅga Sundar, the divine form of Krishna-*prema*."

Lord Chaitanya gave undivided attention to Śrī Mādhavendra Purī, stating that his attachment for serving Lord Krishna’s *kiśora* form in conjugal love was the highest expression of dedication.
