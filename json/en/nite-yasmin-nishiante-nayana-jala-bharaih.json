        "At the end of the night of Śrī Śrī Vṛṣabhānunandinī, She suddenly took him to Her entourage, withdrawing him from the company of throngs of griefstricken souls. A great cry of lamentation arose, their bodies were bathed by their tears. When he was thus stolen away, this world was plunged into the deep darkness of one whose eyes have been stolen away (<i class=\"SongVerse__term\">hṛta</i>—stolen away;<i class=\"SongVerse__term\">nayana-maṇi</i>—jewel of the eye—the internal name of Saraswatī Ṭhākur is ‘Nayana-maṇi’).",
        "(Bereft of the vision of my Divine Master,) Oh my sorrowful eyes (<i class=\"SongVerse__term\">dīna-nayana</i>), (or, Oh saviour of the fallen [Dīna-nayana],) wherever that great soul may be, please quickly take this servitor there! (Although he is my Master named ‘Nayana,’ or ‘one who brings us near,’ in his mercy he shows the miserliness of not taking me unto his company.)"

In the whole Gaura Maṇḍal he is the repository of the glory of those who grant entrance into the fold of the pure Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas. He proudly ascended the lofty throne of preaching the glories of the gift of the Golden Lord Śrī Gaura (the service of Śrī Rādhā-Govinda in Vraja) to the Vaiṣṇavas of Draviḍa (the devotees in South India, who are generally worshippers of Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa). The glory of his dignity shines even in the group of Śrī Gāndharvā, and he holds a pre-eminent position in the intimate circle of Śrī Giridhārī, that is, he is the most beloved of Lord Mukunda.
