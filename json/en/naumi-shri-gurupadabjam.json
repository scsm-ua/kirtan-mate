All the ten directions are illuminated by the effulgence of his supramundane unalloyed perception. He is the dispenser of the genuine proper harmonious adjustment of all the scriptures—the Vedas, the Vedānta, the Upaniṣads, the Purāṇas, etc. headed by the Śrīmad-Bhāgavata-Purāṇa (<i class=\"SongVerse__term\">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>) which holds equal importance with the Vedas.",

I eternally offer my obeisances unto him, my Most Worshipful Divine Master."
