        "O brother, hear my words with rapt attention: The lotus feet of the Vaiṣṇavas are the most valuable treasure in the world. Take shelter of those Vaiṣṇavas, and worship them. Krishna cannot abandon one who worships Him in this way. All others meet a meaningless death."

        "The water which has washed the lotus feet of the Vaiṣṇavas bestows devotional service in pure love of Godhead. There is nothing as effective in attaining this divine love. I place the dust from the lotus feet of the Vaiṣṇavas upon my head. I wear no other ornament."

Actually there is nothing which is as purifying as the water which has washed the lotus feet of the Vaiṣṇavas. This water fulfills all desires."

Poor-hearted Narottam Dās cries, “I cannot maintain my composure any longer. Why have I fallen into such a low condition of life that I cannot get the association of the Vaiṣṇavas?”"
