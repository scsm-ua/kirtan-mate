        "There are ten offences in the chanting of the Hare Krishna <i class=\"SongVerse__term\">mahāmantra</i>, but these are not considered in the chanting of the Pañcha-tattva <i class=\"SongVerse__term\">mantra</i>. Śri Chaitanya Mahāprabhu is the most magnanimous incarnation, for He does not consider the offences of the fallen souls. Thus to derive the full benefit of the chanting of the <i class=\"SongVerse__term\">mahāmantra</i>, we must first take shelter of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu and his associates, the Pañcha-tattva, who are the bestowers of the Hare Krishna <i class=\"SongVerse__term\">mahāmantra</i>."
