You are the divine potency of Śrī Gaura, and you graciously made your advent in this earthly plane, being attracted by the living beings’ virtuous deeds performed throughout many lifetimes."

Yet due to your magnanimous nature, you gave your grace to the whole universe, personally revealing your supereminence as the personification of the mercy potency of Śrī Gaurāṅga. (That is, by coming into this world, I received his grace.)"

With great ecstasy, She expands the joy of loving sweetness in the service of Śrī Krishnachandra, who is otherwise served in four relationships up to parenthood. You, Oh Ṭhākur Bhakti Vinod, can give us the service of that holy Dhām."

        "Translator’s  Note: The preceding prayer to Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur (1838-1914), the pioneer of pure devotion in the recent age, was composed within the lifetime of the author’s Guru, Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur Goswāmī Prabhupād. Upon reading the original Sanskrit verse, Śrīla Prabhupād commented, “Now I am confident that we have one man who is qualified to uphold the standard of our Sampradāya (Divine Succession).”"
