        "Krishna is the lover of Rādhā. He displays many amorous Pastimes in the groves of Vṛndāvan, He is the lover of the cowherd maidens of Vraja, the holder of the great hill named Govardhan, the beloved son of Mother Yaśodā, the delighter of the inhabitants of Vraja, and He wanders in the forests along the banks of the River Yamunā."
