Please cultivate fixed determination to attain only the steady and solid platform whereupon a Vaiṣṇava ever stands. If you neglect worshiping the Lord from this position, then you will ultimately attain a hellish existence."

The desire for spiritual eminence is easily fulfilled when one becomes a devotee of the Lord, for eternal fame automatically follows the heels of a Vaiṣṇava. And that fame is never to be considered a temporary worldly opulence."

The prestige of so-called popularity in the material realm is compared to a treacherous dog-eating witch, and the attempt to live in solitude to supposedly engage in unalloyed bhajan is compared to an entangling network of distraction. Please know that anyone striving in either of these ways verily lives in the hell of Māyā’s illusion."
