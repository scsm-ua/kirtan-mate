        "Desirous of smelling a sweet scent, I sniffed at what I thought to be a fragrant flower. Alas, that flower was odourless like the palāśa flower and instead an insect flew up my nose and bit me. Thinking material life to be sweet like sugarcane, I tried to taste its nectar. Instead, it was like chewing dry wood. In this way all my attempts at enjoyment were false."

Now in my final days, I realise I have died twice, for not only am I leaving this mortal body, but I am also dead while living, having wasted my life in material indulgence."
