        "In the beginning of creation the science of devotional service was received by the four-headed Brahmā from the Supreme Lord Śrī Krishna. Devarṣi Nārada’s understanding of this divine science was obtained from Brahmā. The great sage Krishna Dvaipāyana Vyāsa, who was empowered to compile the Vedic literatures, became a disciple of Devarṣi Nārada. Śrīpād Madhva Āchārya, the founder of the Śuddha-dvaita school of Vedānta philosophy, who visited Vyāsadeva at Badarīkāśram in the thirteenth century to learn from him Vedānta philosophy, calls himself a servant of Krishna Dvaipāyana Vyāsa. Pūrṇaprajña Tīrtha [Madhva] is the guru and sole refuge of Padmanābha Tīrtha."

Raghunāth Dās Goswāmī, a disciple of Advaita Āchārya’s disciple Jadunandan Āchārya, was accepted by Rūpa and Sanātan as their third brother. Raghunāth Dās Goswāmī’s beloved student was Krishnadās Kavirāj Goswāmī. Kṛṣṇādās Kavirāj was an intimate friend of Lokanāth Goswāmī. They lived together in Vṛndāvan and always discussed the topics of Krishna with one another. Lokanāth Goswāmī, a disciple of Gadādhara Paṇḍit, had only one disciple, whose name was Narottam Dās. Narottam Dās was always engaged in the service of his guru, and he also engaged himself in the service of his guru’s intimate friends. Thus he became very dear to Krishnadās Kavirāj Goswāmī. To serve the feet of Narottam Dās Ṭhākur was the only desire of Viśvanāth Chakravartī Ṭhākur, who was the fourth <i class=\"SongVerse__term\">āchārya</i> in disciplic succession from Narottam Dās."
