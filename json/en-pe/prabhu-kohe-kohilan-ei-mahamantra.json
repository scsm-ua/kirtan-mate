        "Śrīman Mahāprabhu declared, “I have told you all this mahāmantra. Chant it earnestly. By doing so, you will attain all perfection. Chant always. There are no rules in that regard. Whether you are resting, eating, or awake—day and night think of Kṛṣṇa and chant His Name aloud. If you have any affection for Me, do not speak of anything other than Kṛṣṇa.”"
